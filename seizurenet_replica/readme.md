I DO NOT OWN THE ORIGINAL SOURCE CODE.
It can be found here: https://github.com/IBM/seizure-type-classification-tuh
This is an extension to the existing code to process the saliency maps.

1. git clone https://github.com/IBM/seizure-type-classification-tuh.git

2. paste the files in this folder to the cloned folder

3. if you haven't preprocessed data yet, do it first (the next step will write to the preprocessed data)

4. run spectograms.py. note that the updated files will probably be 4x the size
